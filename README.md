TennisTracker
=============
This application allows a viewer to track a tennis match, keeping score but also tracking basic statistics about winners, errors, second serves, double-faults and aces.

Initially, the match begins with "Player A" as the first server and "Player B" as the second server. 

If the server hits an ace, or requires a second serve, hit one of the according buttons. If they double fault, hit that button. Otherwise, designate whether the point ended with one of the two players hitting a winner or an error.

This application assumes a "best of five" match, but of course a best of three match will work fine, too.

To view the stats at any time, click the action overflow button and choose stats. To return to the match, click the back button.

Navigating away and resetting:
To navigate away from the application, hit the home button. To end the game and reset (so that returning will create a new game) hit the back button.
